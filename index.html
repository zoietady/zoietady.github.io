            <p>This project is created by <b><em>Euan Giligan</em></b> and <b><em>Zoie Tad-y</em></b> in partial completion of the requirements in the course <b><em>COS30045-Data Visualisation of Swinburne University of Technology</em></b>. This aims to provide viewers with a glance of the ever growing problem that is polution.</p>
            <p>This project utilizes that dataset provided by <b><em>The World Bank Data Catalog</em></b> entitled <b><em>"What a Waste"</em></b>.</p>
            <p> This is mainly comprised of two charts, a choropleth that focuses on location and individual varaibles, and a bubble plot that is aimed to show the relationship between variables. The <b><em> Choropleth</em></b> is meant to show the scale of each country in terms of population, econmic output, and generating waste, while the <b><em>Bubble Plot</em></b> seeks to depict more clearly the realtionship between each contires economic output, population, and waste output.</p>
